== CH1

All functions implemented in `ch1.go`.
Just call a desired function to `main` and run.

=== Copy Input to Output
New line can be `\r\n` on Windows. I skipped this part.


.example run
----
$ go run ch1.go
hello there, are you listening?
hello there, are you listening?
yes, I am.
yes, I am.
^D

=== Count Characters
-----

=== Count Lines
-----
$ go run ch1.go

=== Count Words
----

=== Delete Tabs
As this example uses `#include`. I created a separate package and a seprate file.
Just for demonstration. Also, in `go` arrays are zero indexed. That's why I start from `col := 0`.

$ ./ch1
1       2               3                       4       4       2
1 2  3   4 4 2

Honestly I didn't understand why to we need `tabpos` at all.
Why we just print a space everytime when we find a tab?
