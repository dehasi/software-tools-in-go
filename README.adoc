== Good to Know

Good to know that
> Pascal, like many languages, does not guarantee any particular order for evaluation of logical expressions (or any other expressions, for that matter), nor does
it guarantee that evaluation of a logical expression will terminate as soon as the
truth value is known

That affected code as any other Pascal restrucitons (like funciton "returns").

== Contributing

Improvements are welcome! Feel free to create issues or pull requests.
Feel free to refactor the code to make it more idiomatic for `Go`.
