= Chapter 7 Formatting
:toc: auto


== Notes

> We use IND instead of IN to avoid a possible collision with the keyword in

Because Pascal is case insensitive. I renamed IND => IN because all other commands are two-letters length.


For undeline I used https://howellza.ch/blog/simple-cli-colorizing-in-go/[this] blogpost. 
Technically, it's possible to extend the "formatter" to use colors or bold/italic fonts.
